#### PhD: Creating Computer models of CaMKII/NMDAR dynamics in 3D (Oct 2020 - Sep 2024) {- #sec-phd}
- At the University of Edinburgh.
- Supervised by Melanie Stefan, David Sterratt and Nicola Romano.
- Funded by Medical Research Scotland and CERN openlab.

#### Alan Turing Enrichment Student (Oct 2022 - Jun 2023)
- Awarded a 9 month placement at the Alan Turing Institute head quarters in London (Â£3000).
- Attended AI Ethics and Governance courses
- Participated in Python programming and reproducibility course
- Collaborated with The Turing Way, The Turing Commons and more stakeholders to discuss ethics in neuroinformatics.
- Was the Community Champion for the cohort, which entailed organising social events and bringing people in different areas together.

#### What Data Hazards apply to my PhD? (March 2023)
-  I volunteered and presented a poster at AI UK 2023.
-  I created a summary of the work I do for my PhD to think about what Data Hazards apply to it and for people to have discussions with me about it.
- More information on the [GitHub repo where the project lives](https://github.com/Susana465/DH_Project_CaseStudy). 

#### Data Hazards, Ethics and Reproducibility Hybrid Symposium (March 2023)
- Co-organized and facilitated with [Ceilidh Welsh](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/enrichment-students/ceilidh-welsh).
- The theme of this event was "aligning our values with our research: thinking about how to embed ethics and reproducibility into our work".

- [Documentation on talks materials](https://github.com/Susana465/der_symposium_20230310) is still being updated in the GitHub repository.

#### Open Life Sciences - cohort 6 (Sep 2022 - Jan 2023)
- During my time at [OLS](https://openlifesci.org/) I worked on creating a framework within my PhD that allows the questioning of ethical standards and reproducibility of computer models in Computational Neurobiology, link [here](https://github.com/Susana465/OLS-6-Ethical-standards-and-reproducibility-of-computer-models-in-Neurobiology).

#### More workshops, posters, group facilitations

- [Climate Cafes](https://www.climatepsychologyalliance.org/~cpa/events/500-climate-cafe-jan) with Climate Psychology Alliance.

- [Data Hazards workshops](https://github.com/Susana465/Data_Hazards_workshops). As part of my on-going work with the Data Hazards, I have organised and led multiple iterations of Data Hazard workshops.
