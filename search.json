Democratising artificial intelligence in healthcare: community-driven approaches for ethical solutions. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fhj.2024.100165\nAbstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of possibilities in healthcare, ranging from clinical task automation to disease detection. AI algorithms have the potential to analyse medical data, enhance diagnostic accuracy, personalise treatment plans and predict patient outcomes among other possibilities. With a surge in AI’s popularity, its developments are outpacing policy and regulatory frameworks, leading to concerns about ethical considerations and collaborative development. Healthcare faces its own ethical challenges, including biased datasets, under-representation and inequitable access to resources, all contributing to mistrust in medical systems. To address these issues in the context of AI healthcare solutions and prevent perpetuating existing inequities, it is crucial to involve communities and stakeholders in the AI lifecycle. This article discusses four community-driven approaches for co-developing ethical AI healthcare solutions, including understanding and prioritising needs, defining a shared language, promoting mutual learning and co-creation, and democratising AI. These approaches emphasise bottom-up decision-making to reflect and centre impacted communities’ needs and values. These collaborative approaches provide actionable considerations for creating equitable AI solutions in healthcare, fostering a more just and effective healthcare system that serves patient and community needs.\n\n\nRoman Garcia, S., Welsh, C., Di Cara, N. H., Sterratt, D., Romano, N., & Stefan, M. I. (2024). Data Hazards as an ethical toolkit for neuroscience. https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/yn2j9_\nAbstract: The Data Hazards framework (Zelenkaet al., 2024) is intended to encouragethinking about the ethical implications of data science projects. It takes the formof community-designed data hazard labels, similar to warning labels on chemicals,that can encourage reflection and discussion on what ethical risks are associatedwith a project and how they can be mitigated. In this article, we explain howthe Data Hazards framework can apply to neuroscience. We demonstrate howthe hazards can be applied to one of our own projects, on the computationalmodelling of postsynaptic mechanisms.\n\n\nRoman Garcia, & Steele. (2023).

    "text": "About my work\nI started my PhD in order to better understand how memory works inside our brains. In order to do so, I look at the molecular mechanisms of memory and create computer models of their interactions that can help predict how molecules are working inside neurons.\nI think that in order to create meaningful research, it must challenge the imperialist white supermacist patriarchal culture it sits in. I believe there is a need to move away from historically white, cis-male, centered science, to a science that is much more inclusive and accessible to everyone and especially those who have been historically marginalized.\nReproducibility and bias in science are huge driving forces of how I work. Making reproducible science means a bit more time is needed at the beginning, but in the long run money, time and resources are saved by not repeating the same research over and over again. Similarly, I see no point in creating amazingly reproducible research, if this is carrying sexist, racist, ableist, speciesist or any kind of oppressive bias that continues to disproportionately affect some individuals more than others.\nThese are resons why I combine Ethics with Neuroscience and Computer Science in my work. To create computer models of molecular interactions that are reproducible, and that take into account real-world repercussions.\n\nI am currently…\n\nFinishing my PhD\n\n💪\n\nLooking for jobs\n\n👀\n\nGrowing fruit and vegetables in the garden\n\n🌼",
