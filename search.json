    "text": "Data Hazards as an ethical toolkit for neuroscience, 2024.\nAbstract: The Data Hazards framework (Zelenkaet al., 2024) is intended to encouragethinking about the ethical implications of data science projects. It takes the formof community-designed data hazard labels, similar to warning labels on chemicals,that can encourage reflection and discussion on what ethical risks are associatedwith a project and how they can be mitigated. In this article, we explain howthe Data Hazards framework can apply to neuroscience. We demonstrate howthe hazards can be applied to one of our own projects, on the computationalmodelling of postsynaptic mechanisms.\n\nAvailable as a preprint.\n\n\n\nEthical Standards and Reproducibility of computer models in Neurobiology, Open Life Sciences, 2023.\n\nYou can watch the recorded live session.\n\n\n\nThinking about Ethics in (Computer) Science, Edinburgh College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine Good Practice Showcase, 2022.\n\nGiven with Melanie Stefan and David Sterratt.\nYou can watch the recording here, and access slides here.",

    "text": "About my work\nI am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, funded by Medical Research Scotland. I am interested in learning about Open Science, Ethics, Computer Science, and Neuroscience, and how to mix them all-together.\nI started my PhD in order to better understand how memory works inside our brains. In order to do so, I look at the molecular mechanisms of memory and create computer models of their interactions that can help predict how molecules are working inside neurons.\nI think that in order to create meaningful research, it must challenge the imperialist white supermacist patriarchal culture it sits in. I believe is a need to move away from historically white, cis-male, centered science, to a science that is much more inclusive and accessible to everyone and especially those who have been historically marginalized.\nReproducibility and bias in science are huge driving forces of how I work. Making reproducible science means a bit more time is needed at the beginning, but in the long run money, time and resources are saved by not repeating the same research over and over again. Similarly, I see no point in creating amazingly reproducible research, if this is carrying sexist, racist, ableist, speciesist or any kind of oppressive bias that continues to disproportionately affect some individuals more than others.\nAs an emotional human, I also very much care about the environment (not as separate from humans), and the intersectional impacts of the current climate crisis. I see all parts of my life as inter-connected, not as isolated sections. I work and live to create a new vision of what the world can be.\n\nI am currently…\n\nFinishing my PhD :muscle:\nLooking for jobs :eyes:\nGrowing fruit and vegetables in the garden :strawberry:",
