Data Hazards as an ethical toolkit for neuroscience. https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/yn2j9_\nAbstract: The Data Hazards framework (Zelenkaet al., 2024) is intended to encouragethinking about the ethical implications of data science projects. It takes the formof community-designed data hazard labels, similar to warning labels on chemicals,that can encourage reflection and discussion on what ethical risks are associatedwith a project and how they can be mitigated. In this article, we explain howthe Data Hazards framework can apply to neuroscience. We demonstrate howthe hazards can be applied to one of our own projects, on the computationalmodelling of postsynaptic mechanisms.\n\n\nKuwertz E., Zelenka N., Hanschke V., Di Cara N., Bennet E., Kherroubi Garcia I., Roman Garcia, S., (2023).

Similarly to chemical hazard labels, the Data Hazards serve as a warning of a potential risk, and encourage; description: The labels were co-created as an open-source project, where they will continue to evolve over time with; description: : a mismatched vocabulary and a lack of an accessible structure for discussions.; title: Data Hazards v1.0: an open-source vocabulary of ethical hazards for data-intensive projects; description: The use of data-intensive methods for tasks which impact peoples‚Äô lives continues to accelerate.\n\n\nRoman Garcia, S., (2023) Ethical Standards and Reproducibility of computer models in Neurobiology, Open Life Sciences.\nYou can watch the recorded live session, where me and other OLS-6 participants present the projects we worked on during our time at OLS.\n\n\nRoman Garcia, S., Sterratt, D., & Stefan, M.

    "text": "About my work\nI started my PhD in order to better understand how memory works inside our brains. In order to do so, I look at the molecular mechanisms of memory and create computer models of their interactions that can help predict how molecules are working inside neurons.\nI think that in order to create meaningful research, it must challenge the imperialist white supermacist patriarchal culture it sits in. I believe there is a need to move away from historically white, cis-male, centered science, to a science that is much more inclusive and accessible to everyone and especially those who have been historically marginalized.\nReproducibility and bias in science are huge driving forces of how I work. Making reproducible science means a bit more time is needed at the beginning, but in the long run money, time and resources are saved by not repeating the same research over and over again. Similarly, I see no point in creating amazingly reproducible research, if this is carrying sexist, racist, ableist, speciesist or any kind of oppressive bias that continues to disproportionately affect some individuals more than others.\nThese are resons why I combine Ethics with Neuroscience and Computer Science in my work. To create computer models of molecular interactions that are reproducible, and that take into account real-world repercussions.\n\nI am currently‚Ä¶\n\nFinishing my PhD\n\nüí™\n\nLooking for jobs\n\nüëÄ\n\nGrowing fruit and vegetables in the garden\n\nüåº",
