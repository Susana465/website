Abstract: The Data Hazards framework (Zelenkaet al., 2024) is intended to encouragethinking about the ethical implications of data science projects. It takes the formof community-designed data hazard labels, similar to warning labels on chemicals,that can encourage reflection and discussion on what ethical risks are associatedwith a project and how they can be mitigated. In this article, we explain howthe Data Hazards framework can apply to neuroscience. We demonstrate howthe hazards can be applied to one of our own projects, on the computationalmodelling of postsynaptic mechanisms.

Description: This paper presents the Data Hazards project, which contains a shared, controlled vocabulary of 11 data. Similarly to chemical hazard labels, the Data Hazards serve as a warning of a potential risk, and encourage; description: The labels were co-created as an open-source project, where they will continue to evolve over time with; description: : a mismatched vocabulary and a lack of an accessible structure for discussions.; title: Data Hazards v1.0: an open-source vocabulary of ethical hazards for data-intensive projects; description: The use of data-intensive methods for tasks which impact peoplesâ€™ lives continues to accelerate.
