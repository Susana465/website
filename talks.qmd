#### **Data Hazards as an ethical toolkit for neuroscience, 2024.**
_Abstract: The Data Hazards framework (Zelenkaet al., 2024) is intended to encouragethinking about the ethical implications of data science projects. It takes the formof community-designed data hazard labels, similar to warning labels on chemicals,that can encourage reflection and discussion on what ethical risks are associatedwith a project and how they can be mitigated. In this article, we explain howthe Data Hazards framework can apply to neuroscience. We demonstrate howthe hazards can be applied to one of our own projects, on the computationalmodelling of postsynaptic mechanisms._
